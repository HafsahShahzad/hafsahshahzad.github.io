I am a recent PhD graduate in Computer Engineering from Boston University, where I was advised by <a href="https://people.bu.edu/herbordt/" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Herbordt</a> and collaborated on <a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/research_project/practical-programming-of-fpgas-with-open-source-tools/" target="_blank">Practical Programming of FPGAs with Open Source Tools</a> under the mentorship of  <a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/project_member/ulrich-drepper/" target="_blank">Ulrich Drepper</a>, <a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/project_member/sanjay-arora/" target="_blank">Sanjay Arora</a> and <a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/project_member/ahmed-sanaullah/" target="_blank">Ahmed Sanaullah</a>.

During my PhD, I have worked on increasing performance efficiency of compilers and helping programmers achieve code that is performant, portable and programmable using artificial intelligence. My thesis focuses on deep learning for performance engineering, in particular reinforcement learning and bayesian optimization to enhance system efficiency.

Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.ti.com/" target="_blank">Texas Instruments</a> in post-silicon hardware testing and validation.
